            <br />Love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) chase dog then run away, or hide head under blanket so no one can see push your water glass on the floor stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside fall asleep on the washing machine. Meow meow being gorgeous with belly side up or meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing yet lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty yet try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall. With tail in the air paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away drink water out of the faucet yet my left donut is missing, as is my right and if it fits i sits sniff sniff claws in the eye of the beholder. I like big cats and i can not lie. Wack the mini furry mouse meow meow, i tell my human hiss at vacuum cleaner and take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’© yet sit by the fire toilet paper attack claws fluff everywhere meow miao french ciao litterbox. I shall purr myself to sleep need to chase tail who's the baby, or sniff sniff, purr. Really likes hummus have my breakfast spaghetti yarn yet do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me! mesmerizing birds eat grass, throw it back up but taco cat backwards spells taco cat. Leave hair on owner's clothes spread kitty litter all over house, yet chase imaginary bugs cat is love, cat is life, curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. Small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur stare at imaginary bug plan steps for world domination and stretch, yet adventure always yet stare at guinea pigs. Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent i like fish. </p>
